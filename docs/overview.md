# Healthcare AI Platform — Agentic Health LLM Infrastructure

## 1. Project Vision

This project is a production-grade Healthcare AI Platform powered by:
- Structured Health LLM pipelines
- Multi-agent orchestration
- HIPAA-aligned compliance design
- Interoperability-ready EHR architecture

The goal is to demonstrate a full-stack, real-world deployable healthcare AI system suitable for:
- Clinical NLP
- Patient intake automation
- Decision support (non-diagnostic)
- Interoperability with EMR/EHR systems

This repository is designed specifically for:
- Healthcare AI contracts
- Enterprise Health AI & EHR Integration projects

## 2. Core Capabilities

- Healthcare text structuring (LLM-based)
- Mini AI Agent orchestration
- RAG-based medical knowledge retrieval
- Secure PHI handling design
- HIPAA-aligned audit logging
- FHIR / HL7 interoperability-ready router
- Full demo UI + API + evaluation harness

---

## 3. Target Use Cases

- AI Clinical Intake & Structuring
- Healthcare NLP & Ontology Coding
- AI Health Summarization & Reporting
- AI Agent-based Health Workflow Automation
- Secure AI Pipelines for PHI data

---

## 4. Target Market Alignment

This platform directly aligns with:
- Healthcare SaaS startups
- Medical NLP & Ontology projects
- AI-powered clinical automation products
- EMR / EHR interoperability startups
- HIPAA-compliant AI automation tooling

## 5. Repository Structure Philosophy

This repository is organized as a **true production monorepo**:

- `agents/` → AI orchestration layer  
- `llm/` → Prompt engineering + safety guard  
- `rag/` → Retrieval & Vector DB  
- `api/` → Secure FastAPI / Node backend  
- `interoperability/` → FHIR / HL7 / EHR router  
- `observability/` → HIPAA audit & metrics  
- `compliance/` → Threat model & PHI flow  
- `evaluation/` → LLM & Agent benchmarking  
- `app/` → Frontend demo UI  
- `docs/` → Full solution blueprint  

---

## 6. Compliance & Safety Positioning

This project:
- Does NOT provide medical diagnosis
- Enforces strict PHI zoning
- Implements audit logging & RBAC
- Aligns with HIPAA technical safeguards
- Uses safety boundaries in LLM prompts
